Antares
Physical implementation tools for Xilinx FPGAs.

(C) Copyright 2011 Sebastien Bourdeauducq.
Released under GNU GPL version 3. See file COPYING.

Build requirements:
 * Clang
 * CMake
 * Python

Build/installation instructions:
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ..
 $ make
 # make install

If you want to build and install the chip geometry database (needed to
operate the software), set the environment variable ANTARES_BUILD_DATA=1
before running cmake. This requires ISE and takes several minutes and
several gigabytes of temporary files.
